The senator is elected by indirect universal suffrage by municipal and departmental councilors, and represents territorial collectivities." },
                    q2: { question: "How many senators are there in Gabon?", answer: "The Senate has 102 senators, elected to represent the 9 provinces of Gabon and ensure the voice of territories in Parliament." },
                    q3: { question: "How does one become a senator?", answer: "To be elected senator, one must be Gabonese, be at least 40 years old, enjoy civil and political rights, and be elected by an electoral college composed of municipal and departmental councilors." },
                    q4: { question: "What is the deadline for the Senate to examine a text?", answer: "The Constitution grants the Senate 20 days to examine texts transmitted by the National Assembly. For texts relating to territorial collectivities, this deadline may be extended." },
                    q5: { question: "What is the parliamentary shuttle?", answer: "The shuttle is the back and forth of a bill between the National Assembly and the Senate until an identical text is adopted. In case of persistent disagreement, a JC can be convened." },
                    q6: { question: "Can the Senate block a law?", answer: "No, the Senate cannot definitively block a law. If the disagreement persists after the JC, the National Assembly has the last word." },
                    q7: { question: "Who presides over the Senate?", answer: "The President of the Senate is the second personality of the State after the President of the Republic." },
